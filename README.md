# Lewis-Tac-Toe

### Overview 
This is a tic-tac-toe game created for the requirements of a software architecture and design class. I used a template forked from the sources below and created this mostly following the React tutorial also linked below. Any additional credits are also cited. The purpose of this game is for me to practice using React, GitHub, Azure, and learn more about development and software architecture.
