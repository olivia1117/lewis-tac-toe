# Lewis-Tac-Toe

### Overview 
This is a tic-tac-toe game created for the requirements of a software architecture and design class. I used a template forked from the sources below and created this mostly following the React tutorial also linked below. Any additional credits are also cited. The purpose of this game is for me to practice using React, GitHub, Azure, and learn more about development and software architecture. 

### How to run this application 
If you want to run this project locally, you can clone this repository to your computer. Then open the files in an editor like VSCode. From there you can open a new terminal and then type the command: npm install

This will install the necessary modules listed in package.json. If you don't want this modules to appear as changes or when you commit new changes to the repository, you can add node_modules/ or wherever you stored them into a .gitignore file. 

Then, to start the web application on a local development server, run the command: npm start
This will compile the React app and then open it in a default browser usually at http://localhost:3000
If there are issues with this, you may have set that specific port for something else on your machine so you may need to research how to change that so it can run on your browser locally and view any changes before committing them to GitHub. 

If you do get to a point where you would like to commit any changes, then you can use a terminal or the separate source control center in VSCode to view the changed files and then write a commit message before clicking on the dropdown menu to commit and push the changes. 

If you have this hosted on Azure through GitHub, then you can check its build progress through GitHub actions and then once it's built successfully, then you can view the Azure site through the link.
